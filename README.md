# Crushtool

[![Build Status](https://git.cmacinfo.com/chris/crushtool-rs/badges/master/build.svg)](https://git.cmacinfo.com/chris/crushtool-rs/builds)

This library can be used by anyone wanting to manipulate Ceph [crushmaps](http://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/rados/operations/crush-map/).
This project started out as a fun project to see if I could understand how Ceph
crushmaps are put together and encoded/decoded but it has evolved since then. Someday
I'd love to see this binary being used by the upstream Ceph project.
